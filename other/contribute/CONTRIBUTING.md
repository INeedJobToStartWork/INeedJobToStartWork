<!-- ## üßë‚Äçüîß Maintenance

This section is for maintainers with write access, or if you want to maintain your own forks.

### Update Dependencies

<!-- ### Releasing -->

<!-- <table><tr><td width="500px" valign="top">

#### Build Locally

For this type of setup, the building and publishing process is done on your local machine. Make sure you have your local [`npm` logged in](http://npm.github.io/installation-setup-docs/installing/logging-in-and-out.html) before doing that.

In `package.json`, we usually have:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepublishOnly": "nr build"
  }
}
```

So whenever you run `npm publish`, it will make sure you have the latest change in the distribution.

<!-- #### Build on CI

> When maintaining your own fork, you might need to see `NPM_TOKEN` secret to your repository for it to publish the packages. -->

### Node Version Manager

Node Version Managers are responsible for fast switching between node versions.

Currently in most of project we support **only [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)**

| Name                       | Support |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Node Version Manager (NVM) | ‚úÖ      |
| N                          | ‚ùå      |
| Fast Node Manager (FNM)    | ‚ùå      |
| Volta                      | ‚ùå      |
| PNPM                       | ‚ùå      |

#### NVM

Probably most famous Node Version Manager.

## üì¶ Package Manager

Package managers are responsible for installing and managing packages at project.

We use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) for most of the projects. <br/>
We highly recommend you to install [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni#readme) so you don't need to worry about the package manager when switching across different projects.

We will use `ni`'s commands in the following code snippets. If you are not using it, you can do the conversion yourself: `ni = pnpm install`, `nr = pnpm run`.

### Windows - fix alias

After `ni` installation you can have problems with using it because at windows at `ni` is existing alias for `New-Item`.

To remove it you can use:

#### PowerShell 6.x

```powershell copy
  Remove-Alias -Name ni
```

##### under Powershell 5.x

```powershell copy
  Remove-Item -Force Alias:ni
```

### Linting

We use linters for detecting and avoiding possibles bugs/bad practises induring development.

For Linting we are using [`eslint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc#readme) with [`@ineedj/eslintrc`](https://github.com/INeedJobToStartWork/INeedJobToStartWork/tree/main/config/eslintrc#readme) config which have `+1k` strict rules and is high customizable with extensive support.

Check it if you want to know more about config.

### Formatting

We are using `prettier` or `eslint` for formatting code lines to avoid individual coder style and make one global, you can check it easily, just check `lint` script.</br></br>
For both cases we are using `INEEDJ` configs, `@ineedj/prettierrc` and `@ineedj/eslintrc`

### Monorepo

Monorepo handlers help us to manage many repos in single repository.
To this we are using `turborepo`

### Changesets

To handle versioning and changelogs in our monorepo, we use `changesets`. <br/>This tool helps us create and manage changesets for each package, ensuring that updates are tracked and documented properly. <br/><br/>When you make changes to a package, you can create a changeset by running:

#### Changelog

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

#### Release log

```bash
pnpm changeset version
```

### Commiting

To make commiting stage faster and commit messages more beauty, we are using `commitsmile`

It's simple CLI commit handler.

```bash copy
pnpm commitsmile
```
